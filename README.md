a simple and hackable build script for c projects

# installation
just copy the script to your project and hack around it, or put it in some directory found in your `$PYTHON_PATH`, and then import it in your script with `import aods`.

`aods` is also found in the arch user repository, and you can install it with
```bash
yay -S python-aods
```

# why `aods`?
i am bad at naming things, so i just smashed my keyboard and `aods` was born.

small and hackable build system for c 

# installation
just copy the script to your project and hack around it, or put it in some directory found in your `$PYTHON_PATH`, and then import it in your script with `import aods`.

`aods` is also found in the arch user repository, and you can install it with
```bash
yay -S python-aods
```

# usage
take a look at the source code, as well as to some of my projects using it, like [waytooeasy](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/waytooeasy.git) and [mwc](https://github.com/dqrk0jeste/mwc.git).

# why `aods`?
i am bad at naming things, so i just smashed my keyboard and `aods` was born.
